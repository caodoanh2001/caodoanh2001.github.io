Our study **"Improving Human-object Interaction with Auxiliary Semantic Information and Enhanced Instance Representation"** has been accepted to be published in "**Pattern Recognition Letters" (SCI, Q1, IF = 5.1).**
I want to give special thanks to Thinh V. Le and Huyen Nguyen for their efforts in this work. This study is also the result of undergraduate thesis of Thinh & Huyen. This study is also on collaboration with UIT-Together Research Group.
In this work, we propose three key modules: Enhanced Interaction Pointers (EIP), Semantic-guided (SG) and Multi-level cross-attention (MCA) based on the HOTR model to improve itself for human-object interaction (HOI) problem.

Authorship contribution statement:
- Khang Nguyen: Project administration, Supervision, Idea confirmation.
- Thinh V. Le: Implementation (Idea implementation, feature extraction, training & evaluation on two benchmarks: V-COCO and HICO-DET), Writing – review & editing
- Huyen Nguyen: Writing (specially focus on linguistic aspects) – review & editing
- **Doanh C. Bui**: Conceptualization (EIP, SG, MCA), Implementation (only support Thinh V. Le), Writing – review & editing

We will publish our source code and checkpoints for this study soon!

**P/s**: I really appreciate the efforts of two undergraduate students: Thinh V. Le and Huyen Nguyen, who were working with me when we were all undergraduate students, to complete this study, specially Thinh. Thinh is a hard-working student. His self-study ability, knowledge, and coding are very good. Most of works of implementation in this study are done by him. I hope that in the future, I will have chance to continue to do research with Thinh. And I wish he will continue to develop himself, leverage all chances coming to him, to become an excellent student in the future! Huyen Nguyen also showed her effort and performed co-working ability pretty well, I also believe that she will achieve further achievements in the future.

**P/s 2**: We all know that papers are just the results of researching period, and they are not that all, they are just some milestones. We should continue to try our best in the academic career, to bring not only theorical but also practical research to the community. There is a long road to go for achieving this.

Thank you for reading!
