We are thrilled to announce our outstanding achievement, securing the 1st position in Track 1 of the UPAR Challenge at the WACV2024-RWS Workshop. Our accomplishment is attributed to the development of an advanced AI-based solution addressing the crucial task of pedestrian attribute recognition, with significant implications for applications such as tracking and retrieval.

Meet our dedicated team:

1. Doanh C. Bui (Leader): Master's student at the School of Electrical Engineering, Korea University
2. Thinh V. Le: Undergraduate researcher at the University of Information Technology, VNU-HCM
3. Hung Ba Ngo: Postdoctoral researcher at the Graduate School of Data Science, Chonnam National University
