I am pleased to announce that I am selected as the final recipient of the Hyundai Global Fellowship program.

This scholarship has a big coverage.
- Full tuition fee (including entrance fee) 
- Learning support fee (1,000,000won per month)
- Settlement allowance (only 1 time when I enter the school) 
- Graduation celebration incentive (only 1 time when graduate).

In the 2023 Spring semester, I will pursue a Masterâ€™s degree in Computer Engineering at Korea University, Korea, with full support from this scholarship!

Thank you for reading.
