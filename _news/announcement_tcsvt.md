We are pleased to announce that our paper titled "Transformer-based Spatio-Temporal Unsupervised Traffic Anomaly Detection in Aerial Videos" has been accepted by IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems for Video Technology **(IF = 8.4)**.

Authors: Tung Minh Tran, Doanh C. Bui, Tam V. Nguyen, and Khang Nguyen. This paper is the result of a joint project between myself and Dr. Tung Minh Tran (University of Information Technology, VNU-HCM), Prof. Tam V. Nguyen (University of Dayton), and Prof. Khang Nguyen (University of Information Technology, VNU-HCM).

In this paper, we present a Transformer-based method for unsupervised anomaly detection in the context of traffic at roundabouts. The full manuscript and code will be released soon!
