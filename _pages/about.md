My name is Doanh C. Bui, and I am currently pursuing a master's degree in Electrical Engineering at Korea University, where I am in my final semester under the supervision of Prof. Jin Tae Kwak at the [QuIIL Laboratory](kwaklab.net). Prior to this, I obtained a Bachelorâ€™s degree in Computer Science from the University of Information Technology (UIT), VNU-HCM in 2022, where I was supervised by Dr. Khang Nguyen at the [UIT-Together Laboratory](https://uit-together.github.io/). From November 2022 to February 2023, I also served as a teaching assistant at the Faculty of Software Engineering at UIT, where I was responsible for lecturing practice credits for the Introduction to Programming course during the Fall semester of 2022.

Throughout my academic journey, I have focused on various aspects of Computer Vision, specifically in areas such as Object Detection, Document Image Understanding, Image Captioning, and Human-Object Interaction. Presently, my research revolves around leveraging image processing techniques for histopathology images.
