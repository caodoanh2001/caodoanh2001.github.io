I am Doanh C. Bui, a Bachelor of Computer Science graduate from the University of Information Technology (UIT), VNU-HCM. I completed my degree in September 2022. For a brief period, from November 2022 to February 2023, I served as a teaching assistant at the Faculty of Software Engineering, UIT. Currently, I am pursuing a master's degree in the School of Electrical Engineering at Korea University, where I am in my third semester, under the supervision of Prof. Jin Tae Kwak.

Throughout my academic journey, I have focused on various aspects of Computer Vision, specifically in areas such as Object Detection, Document Image Understanding, Image Captioning, and Human-Object Interaction. Presently, my research revolves around leveraging image processing techniques for histopathology images.
