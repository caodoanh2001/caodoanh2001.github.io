Hello, this is Doanh C. Bui. I graduated with a Bachelor of Computer Science from the University of Information Technology (UIT), VNU-HCM, in September 2022. I have been a teaching assistant at the Faculty of Software Engineering, UIT, from November 2022 to February 2023. In the 2023 Spring Semester, I will pursue a Master's degree in Computer Engineering at Korea University, Korea, with full support from Hyundai Motor Chung Mong-koo scholarship. My research directions include problems related to Computer Vision, such as Object detection, Document Images Understanding, Image Captioning, and Human-object Interaction.
