Hi, I'm Doanh. I completed my MSc in Computer Engineering at the School of Electrical Engineering, Korea University (03/2023 - 02/2025). Prior to this, I earned a BSc in Computer Science from the University of Information Technology, VNU-HCM (08/2019 - 09/2022). During this time, I also served as a teaching assistant in the Faculty of Software Engineering at the University of Information Technology, VNU-HCM (10/2022 - 03/2023). Throughout my academic journey, I have focused on various aspects of Computer Vision, including Object Detection, Document Image Understanding, Image Captioning, and Human-Object Interaction. Currently, my research centers on applying advanced image processing techniques to histopathology images.
