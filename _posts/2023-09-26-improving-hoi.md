Our article **"Improving Human-object Interaction with Auxiliary Semantic Information and Enhanced Instance Representation"** has been accepted to be publish in "**Pattern Recognition Letters" (SCIE, Q1, IF = 5.1).**
I want to give special thanks to Thinh V. Le and Huyen Nguyen for their efforts in this work. This study is also the result of undergraduate thesis of Thinh & Huyen. This study is also on collaboration with UIT-Together Research Group.
In this work, we propose three key modules: Enhanced Interaction Pointers (EIP), Semantic-guided (SG) and Multi-level cross-attention (MCA) based on the HOTR model to improve itself for human-object interaction (HOI) problem.

Authorship contribution statement:
- Khang Nguyen: Project administration, Supervision, Idea confirmation.
- Thinh V. Le: Implementation (Idea implementation, feature extraction, training & evaluation on two benchmarks: V-COCO and HICO-DET), Writing – review & editing
- Huyen Nguyen: Writing (specially focus on linguistic aspects) – review & editing
- **Doanh C. Bui**: Conceptualization (EIP, SG, MCA), Implementation (only support Thinh V. Le), Writing – review & editing

We will publish our source code and checkpoints for this study soon!

**P/s**: I really appreciate the efforts of two undergraduate students: Thinh V. Le and Huyen Nguyen, who were working with me when we were both undergraduate students, to complete this study, specially Thinh. Thinh is a hard-working student. His self-study ability, knowledge, and coding are very good. Most of works of implementation in this study are done by him. I hope that in the future, I will have chance to continue to do research with Thinh. And I wish he will continue to develop himself, leverage all chances coming to him, to become an excellent student in the future! Huyen Nguyen also showed her effort and performed co-working ability pretty well, I also believe that she will achieve further achievements in the future.
