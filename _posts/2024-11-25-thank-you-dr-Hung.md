# Thank you! Dr. Hung

Throughout my masterâ€™s journey, I would like to express my sincere gratitude to Dr. Hung, who is currently a postdoctoral researcher at Chonnam National University. Together, we have shared some of the most challenging and joyful moments in both research and life. Dr. Hung has also guided me significantly in taking my first steps toward studying abroad in Korea, and I deeply appreciate his support.

Additionally, Dr. Hung and I collaborated on several manuscripts. For me, this experience was not just about conducting research; it was also an opportunity for us to understand each other better, which brought us much closer.

Without a doubt, if I had not met Dr. Hung in Korea, my life would have been much more difficult. Once again, thank you so much, Dr. Hung, my big brother.
